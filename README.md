# NiftyWindowsImproved

This is a clone of Enovatic Products Nifty Windows, a script that allows you to use mouse shortcuts to move windows around more efficiently
Link to original: http://www.enovatic.org/products/niftywindows/introduction/

To run, add this code to your currently running AHK script

This code is updated for these functions:

Double right click on window => Will maximize window if it is not maximized, will restore down window if not maximized
(instead of closing the window)

Removed all functionality for fourth and fifth mouse buttons, so that you can use other macros for those keys.

A list of the rest of the features is linked to their website: http://www.enovatic.org/products/niftywindows/features/


Bugs: when double left clicking, ahk will enter escape, which will a majority of the time close the context menu. Sometimes it doesn't
